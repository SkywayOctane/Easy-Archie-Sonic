Dr. Eggman wants nothing less than total planetary domination, through a process known as \"roboticization\" - the act of turning a living creature in to a cold, robotic slave. At the center of this struggle are seven mysterious \"Chaos Emeralds\" that radiate a strange, otherworldly energy.\n\nClassic Era (#1-71)\nAdventure Era (#72-159)\nModern Era (#160-247)\nReboot (#252-290)",
